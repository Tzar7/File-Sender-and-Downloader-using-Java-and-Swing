This is a file sender and downloader.


This Desktop-based application works on the client and server architecture model developed using socket programming in Java.

Java socket programming is used in the desktop application's client and server architectural concept. Through socket programming, several devices may communicate through a network. Sockets are used in this instance to facilitate communication between the client-side and server-side components of the program.

The client-server architecture of the program uses a desktop application running on a user's computer as the client and a different entity, the server, to process requests and provide results. While the server component is hosted on a distant computer accessed via the network, the client component is installed and run on the user's computer.

Its functionalities include :

a. Sending any files between Server and Client.

b. Clean interface with proper alignment of text.

c. Review while before Downloading the file.

d. Scrollbar.

The project is divided into two parts i.e Client and Server,

Client:

The client request to the server to upload the file with the same local host and host of the server and establish the connection, the user has to choose the file and then send it using the button, once the user clicks the file gets uploaded on the server.

 

Server :

While running the server file the server opens up the connection to get the request from the client to establish the connection which is done locally using localhost and port, both the server and client are configured with the same localhost and port which enables it to run the file locally.

Whenever the request connection is sent to the server from the client the server catches the request and uploads it to the server it remains on the server until the connection is closed, the user can click on the uploaded files on the server and download them from the prompt while on click. While the Download prompt has a review of the file that the user is going to download and asks Are you sure to download the file with its file name for assurance
